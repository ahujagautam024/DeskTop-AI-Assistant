Subject: Review of Your Last Two Status Reports

Dear [Employee's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss your last two status reports and address a few concerns that have come to my attention.

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge your effort in submitting your reports on time. Your dedication to meeting deadlines is appreciated and reflects your professionalism.

However, I have noticed a recurring issue in your last two reports â€“ the lack of sufficient detail. As a supervisor, it is crucial for me to have a clear understanding of the progress you have made on your assigned tasks, any challenges you have encountered, and how you plan to mitigate them. Unfortunately, the information provided in your recent reports has been somewhat vague and insufficient in explaining these key aspects.

Open communication and transparency are essential in fostering a productive work environment. Therefore, I kindly request that you provide more comprehensive updates in your future status reports. Here are a few suggestions to improve the quality of your reports:

1. Include specific details: Provide clear and concise descriptions of the tasks you have completed or are currently working on. Mention any obstacles you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome them.

2. Quantify your progress: Whenever possible, quantify your accomplishments in terms of percentages, numbers
